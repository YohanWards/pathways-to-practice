# DTI data - exploratory analysis

1. Check and tidy up the dataframe 'sub.data' - i.e. make sure that the relevant variables are labelled as factors. Recode the factors of the data frame with meaningful labels. I recommend adding a factor that contains a meaningful name for each tract

2. Pull out some basic frequencies. For example, how many subjects do we have session 1 data for? How many do we have session 1 and session 2 data for?

3. Perform some simple visualisations of the data to identify outliers and determine the normality of the data - for example boxplots and qqplots. 

4. Decide whether to exclude any outlliers. If so, remove them from the data frame

5. Plot your final distribution as a raincloud plot, save it in the folder 'plots' as YOURINITIALS_dti-rainclouds

6. Save clean data as a csv file in cleaned-data as YOURINITIALS_dti-cleaned.csv
